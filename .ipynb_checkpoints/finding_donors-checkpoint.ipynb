    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners.

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",

    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "Decision Trees  \n",
    "- Decision trees can be used e.g. to screen potential candidates for a new job.\n",
    "- Decision trees implicitly select features and do not require high effort from users in terms of data preparation. They are intuitive, easy to interpret and can be visualized to understand its nature.\n",
    "- Decision trees are prone to overfitting. A very complicated decision tree has a low bias and cannot generalize to new data.\n",
    "- Decision trees belong to supervised learning algorithms and can be used for classification problems (which we are trying to solve in this project). They can handle both continuous and categorical variables and are easy and fast to implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "AdaBoost Classifiers  \n",
    "- AdaBoost algorithms can be used for example to detect fraudulent banking transactions. AdaBoost algorithms are used in a variety of fields such as biology, computer vision or speech processing.\n",
    "- AdaBoost belongs to ensemble learners, so it combines weak learners to create a better model in the end. Therefore, AdaBoost is not prone to overfitting and can generalize well on data.\n",
    "- AdaBoost is sensitive to noise and outliers in the data and may find a suboptimal solution.\n",
    "- AdaBoost generally performs well on classification problems. As a meta algorithm, it combines weak classifiers. Accordingly, it can achieve good classification results with much less tuning of hyperparameters. I am curious to see if it performs better than a pure decision tree algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Support Vector Machines  \n",
    "- SVM algorithms can be used for example to predict the likelihood that a user clicks on an online advertisement.\n",
    "- SVMs are applicable for linearly separable and non-linearly separable data. The solution will be a global minimum and not a local minium. Due to the Kernel methods, SVMs are flexible when it comes to the form of decision boundaries. They can generalize well given good parameters.\n",
    "- SVMs are not very transparent for the user. Since the dimension may be high it is hard to understand the decision making. \n",
    "- SVMs are heavily used for classification problems. I selected this algorithm as it provides many opportunities for optimization and tuning (C, kernel, degree, etc.) which I would like to experiment with in this project.\n",

    "I believe that the AdaBoost Classifier is appropriate for this classification problem. The F-beta-score for the complete sample_size is 0.72 and clearly better than the score for the decision tree (0.63) and support vector machine algorithm (0.67). The decision tree algorithm clearly overfits, the scores on the training sets are high, but it does not generalize well on the testing set. The training time for the support vector machine algorithm is very high and grows exponentially. Therefore, I will proceed with the AdaBoost algorithm."

    "The AdaBoost algorithm belongs to ensemble methods. Ensemble methods are a collection of algorithms that can be divided into Bagging and Boosting. Bagging is like if we were to write a test and we wanted to ask our friends for the answers. We combine the answers we got from our friends and take the average answer to solve our own problem. Boosting is similar, but it tries to differentiate between the friends strengths. So, the friend who works as scientist would answer science related questions, the philosopher answers philosophy questions, and so on. In the end, we combine those expert friends into one smart friend to get an answer.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In analogy to the friends example, AdaBoost is a Boosting algorithm which takes different weak learners and combines them into one final model, according to their weights. A weak learner is a model which performs slightly better than random guessing. However, the weak learners for boosting algorithms are most likely very accurate. AdaBoost uses decision trees with a single split for the weak learners. This means that the data is split on a single feature within our census data e.g. capital gain or education level to identify potential donors. If a split was done, we check if we identified the right persons (>50K) or not. If we misclassified persons, we will take this into account for the next split in our data. The model learns sequentially by taking into account the misclassifications. Like that, we iterate over many different features in our census data and use them for classification. By combining all these sub-solutions, we get our final model to predict if a person earns more than 50K per year or not.\n",

    "- Import [`sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/0.17/modules/generated/sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV.html) and [`sklearn.metrics.make_scorer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html).\n",
    "- Initialize the classifier you've chosen and store it in `clf`.\n",
    " - Set a `random_state` if one is available to the same state you set before.\n",
    "- Create a dictionary of parameters you wish to tune for the chosen model.\n",
    " - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`.\n",
    " - **Note:** Avoid tuning the `max_features` parameter of your learner if that parameter is available!\n",
    "- Use `make_scorer` to create an `fbeta_score` scoring object (with $\\beta = 0.5$).\n",
    "- Perform grid search on the classifier `clf` using the `'scorer'`, and store it in `grid_obj`.\n",
    "- Fit the grid search object to the training data (`X_train`, `y_train`), and store it in `grid_fit`.\n",

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
